This repository is meant to serve as a setup and lap-time guide for the F1 game. The purpose of this project is to help improve lap-times across multiple tracks on the game. The code shows you a custom setup for specific track, computes the difference between your time and the real life pole time and tells you which sectors you can improve in. By making a few tweaks to your car setup you could potentially gain a few tenths over the course of one lap on the game and maximize the performance of your car.
